# Subclasses with Animals Lab

## Introduction

In this lab you will be using your knowledge of classes to build an Animal class, complete with properties, getters and setters. After completing the class, you will then create subclasses of Animal called Mammal and Reptile. Finally, you will create at least one subclass of Mammal, and one subclass of Reptile, making them whatever animals you want.

Each subclass should have some unique property that differentiates it from its parent class. For instance, a reptile could have a boolean to determine if it has a shell, or a snake could have a boolean to determine if it is poisonous.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an Animal class with the following properties set in the constructor: mNumLegs, mTopSpeed, mIsEndangered, mName.
- Create subclasses of Animal called Mammal and Reptile
- Create at least one subclass of Mammal, and one subclass of Reptile
- Each subclass must have something that makes it unique from its parent class.

**Bonus:**
- Create more than the minimum number of mammal or reptile subclasses

#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this lab.
