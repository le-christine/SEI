## Exercise

#### Requirements

- *Fork* this repository so you have a copy in your github account
- *Clone* your forked repo onto your machine
- Open the [`starter-code`](starter-code/) folder as a project in IntelliJ
- Modify the starter code per the instructions for problems 1-5 in the `main()` method of [`Main.java`](starter-code/src/Main.java)
- Save your code and *commit* it to git
- After you've commited all your code, *push* it to github
- Finally, submit a *pull request* back to the original repo so we can see your code
- You are welcome to help each other, but everyone must submit their own code

**Bonus:**
- Problems 6 and 7 in the `main()` method are bonus problems

#### Starter code (if needed)

[`starter-code`](starter-code/) contains a simple IntelliJ project. The specific instructions for each problem are written in the comments of [`Main.java`](starter-code/src/Main.java).

#### Deliverable

Your *pull request* with your completed code is the deliverable. Submitting the pull request is how you "hand in" the assignment.
