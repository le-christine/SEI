## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Sometimes we all need a bit of guidance in our life. This afternoon, we will be creating a simple 'magic-eight ball' that is run on the command line. Like a real 'magic-eight ball' will give a random answer to the question on our minds.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a method (ex. `getRandomNumber()`) that returns a random number between 0 and 8.
- Create a method (ex. `rollTheBall()`) that uses the first method to get a random number, and then uses that number to print a statement to the console.

  - The 20 Traditional saying on the magic-eight ball are:
      - It is certain
      - It is decidedly so      
      - Without a doubt      
      - Yes, definitely      
      - You may rely on it      
      -  As I see it, yes      
      - Most likely      
      - Outlook good      
      - Yes      
      - Signs point to yes      
      - Reply hazy try again      
      - Ask again later      
      - Better not tell you now      
      - Cannot predict now      
      - Concentrate and ask again      
      - Don't count on it      
      - My reply is no      
      - My sources say no      
      - Outlook not so good      
      - Very doubtful
  - Feel free to use 9 of these sayings (start at 0) or to use your own.

- Create a method (ex. rollAgain()) that asks if the user wishes to play again, and responds accordingly. Use the Scanner class.
- Start the roll from the main method.

**Bonus:**
- User input should be case insensitive, and spaces before or after the words should not matter.
- Add a countdown, with delay, so that the trepidation is high when the answer is given.
- Look up and use a case statement if appropriate.
- Create a visual representation of the magic-eight ball.
- Make it a talking ball by adding a second level of questioning.

#### Starter code

There is no starter code!  Please create a new IntelliJ project. Refer back to the example given during the functions-and-scope-lesson for an example of interacting with a user through the command line.

#### Deliverable

We expect to be able to ask a question and receive a response from the powers that be, well, the magic algorithms anyway.
