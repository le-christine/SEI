## Requirements

Respond to the following questions based on what we've learned (and maybe what we haven't covered yet).

---

## Questions

1. What's the difference between **member variables** (also called **instance variables**) and **class variables** (with the `static` keyword)? Which can be accessed without creating an instance of the class?

2. Does it make sense to write **getter** and **setter** methods for a `public` member variable? What about `private` variables?

3. What are some benefits of making member variables `private`?

4. If Class A extends Class B, which is the superclass and which is the subclass? Which would you call the parent, and which would you call the child?

5. What does it mean for a class to **inherit** methods or variables (or both) from its parent class?

6. Consider the following code, where the `Refrigerator` class extends the `Appliance` class, and `getTemperature()` is a method in `Refrigerator`, but **not** in `Appliance`:

    ```
    Appliance myAppliance = new Refrigerator();
    double temperature = myAppliance.getTemperature();
    ```

   Why will this call to `getTemperature()` cause an error? How will **casting** help solve this issue?

7. In a normal class (also called a **concrete** class), do you need to **implement** all the methods, or can you simply **declare** some? What about in an `abstract` class?

8. What about an `interface`? Can you implement any methods in an `interface`? Can you declare methods in an `interface`?

9. Can you create an instance of an `abstract` class? Also, look up the Java keyword `final` and see if you can explain why a class **cannot** be both `abstract` and `final`.

10. What happens when a method **overrides** another method? If parent and child classes have methods with the same name, when you call that method on an instance of the child class, which implementation of the method will be executed?

11. What's the relationship between `List`, `LinkedList`, and `ArrayList`? Why do we call a method **polymorphic** if it takes an input of type `List` rather than an input of type `LinkedList` or `Arraylist`? Why is that useful?

### Deliverable

## Additional Resources

Refer to the "Classes and Objects" lesson, the "Subclasses" lesson, and the "Abstract Classes and Interfaces" lesson.

Feel free to do a Google search for these concepts as well. There are plenty of Java tutorial websites and Stack Overflow posts that can help you. But be sure to write up your answers in your own words â€” copying and pasting some text does **not** help you actually learn (and is, in fact, cheating).
