## Opening (5 min)

We've already seen quite a bit about how Java allocates data, objects, arrays, collections, and more. But we've glossed over a few subtle points:
- Where does Java put all this data?
- We can assume that memory is allocated as needed, but where does that memory come from?
- How does Java manage that memory?
- How does memory get reclaimed when the data is no longer required?

This is where the garbage collector comes in. (Don't worry, it isn't as ominous as it sounds.)

## The Garbage Collector (10 min) 

Before Java entered the picture, earlier languages like C and C++ required the programmer to **allocate** memory as it was needed, then **deallocate** it once it was no longer needed. Java introduced the concept of a **garbage collector**, which relinquished programmers from the duties of basic memory allocation or deallocation. 

The technology behind garbage collection has greatly evolved in the last 20 years or so, and there are large companies that make a career out of optimizing garbage collection. We won't get into the precise details, but the common theme is that the JVM allocates an area of memory called the **heap**, where it stores all objects.
 
When the heap starts to fill up, Java runs a background process (the garbage collector) that looks at every object in the heap and traces its references transitively to determine if they're still directly or indirectly referenced by any live thread. If they're not, then they're eligible for collection.

The garbage collector will mark those for collection and then, in a sweep process, remove that memory and perform a compaction so the memory once again becomes available.

Consider the following program:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    String message = "This is message " + i;
    System.out.println(message);
}
```

<summary>Answer</summary>
	
At the end of each loop iteration, the `message` object created during that iteration is no longer reachable. It wasn't assigned, it has no references, and there's no way to ever get it back.
	
</details>

Yes, it's eligible for garbage collection.

## Heap vs. Stack (10 min) 

You can specify the heap size when you launch your program using launch flags:

```sbtshell
-Xms allocates the initial (and minimum) heap size.
-Xmx allocates the maximum heap size. 
```

For example, the following will allocate an initial memory of 10 GB and increase that to 100 GB:

```java
java -Xms10g -Xmx100g MyCode
```

If your `-Xmx` setting is greater than your `-Xms` setting, then Java will start with an initial heap size equal to your `-Xms` setting and allocate more heap as needed until the `-Xmx` value is reached. 

#### Default Heap Size

If you don't specify a heap size, Java will allocate a default heap size for you based on your machine's physical memory. However, it's a good practice to determine your maximum expected heap size by observing the program during execution using tools like Linux's `ps` or `top`.

#### The Stack

Note that, when your program executes, even if there isn't a single object allocated, it still uses some memory to keep track of the call stack of every thread running.

For example, if Method A calls Method B calls Method C, Java must remember that, when Method C exits, it must return to the spot in Method B that called it and, when that returns, return to Method A. This memory is called the **stack** and is distinct from the heap. 

The stack also holds any method-local data that will be swept off once the method returns. The stack works on a 
"first in, first out" (aka FIFO) basis: It's allocated and data is assigned, then methods call other methods, allocating more stack space. Once a method returns, the stack is swept in a FIFO manner, so the next frame in the stack (representing the calling method) becomes the top of the stack, and so on.

## Demo: `OutOfMemory` Error (10 min) 

Does this mean Java can never run out of memory? 

What do we think will happen when we run this program?

```java
public class OOMError {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        
	for(int i = 0; ; i++) {
            Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
            System.out.printf("Iteration: %d total memory: %d free memory: %d%n", i, runtime.totalMemory(), runtime.freeMemory());
            list.add(new String[10_000_000]);
        }
    }
}

```

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

import static java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime;

public class OOMError {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        List<String[]> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 0; ; i++) {
            Runtime runtime = getRuntime();
            System.out.printf("Iteration: %d total memory: %d free memory: %d%n", i, runtime.totalMemory(), runtime.freeMemory());
            list.add(new String[10_000_000]);
        }
    }
}

```


> **Knowledge Check**: Can someone explain what happened? 

In this program, we continuously create a large array and store it in a `List`. We display the total and available memory on each iteration.

Eventually, because every object is referenced by our `List`, nothing is eligible for garbage collection, and we exhaust the heap. Java runtime throws up its hands with an `OutOfMemory` error.

Here are two reasons a program might ever run out of memory:

1. The program's memory requirements might just exceed the allocated memory. If you have a lot of live data or objects, then you need to allocate enough memory for the program to run. This can be determined by watching the program run in development under a production-like load.
1. You might have a **memory leak**. A memory leak occurs when objects are allocated but not released when done — for example, collecting them without end in a list and never letting them go. Another common cause of memory leaks comes from forgetting to release connection resources, such as database or file system connections. To locate these, review your code, looking at all of your collections to ensure they're not growing without bound and checking all of your connections to ensure you're releasing them when done. Make sure to use Java 7's `try... with` resources syntax as a defense against memory leaks. 

## Resolving an `OutOfMemory` Error (10 min)

So, it's possible to run out of memory. That means we should be asking ourselves, "What do we do when that happens?"

Our memory leak generator is an extreme example of what can happen if our program creates objects with reckless abandon. To prevent this, make sure you're not allowing collections to grow indefinitely.

If your collection belongs to a singleton object or is a static reference, then many objects might be adding to it. If an unlimited number of objects are being added, you need to rethink your program design. 

Some other preventive measures include:
- Reusing duplicates.
- Using least-recently-used structures, which automatically remove items that have not been referenced for a specified amount of time.
- Consider using weak references (see Java's [WeakHashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html)), which clean up when memory is running out.

The bottom line is that **fixing** an `OutOfMemory` error is tricky and generally means changing something about the way your program is designed. (Do a quick search on Stack Overflow and you'll see just how many people are trying to figure this out.) It's important to take **preventive measures** when you set up a program to ensure this doesn't happen (and yes, we know — easier said than done).

## Conclusion (5 min) 

Let's check what we covered:
- How does the garbage collector determine what's eligible for collection? 
- How do you set the heap size for a program?
- What happens if you don't set one?
- How does the stack compare to the heap?
- Describe how to prevent an `OutofMemory` error.
