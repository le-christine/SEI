## Opening - Recap of Streams and Pipelines (5 min)

To recap, in the previous lesson we learned that:
- a stream is a sequence of elements that carries values from a source through a pipeline via lambda expressions 
- We learned that a pipeline is a sequence of one or more stream operations, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregation operations.
- We learned that intermediate operations produce other streams, and terminal operations produce resulting values.

In this lesson we will go into more detail about how to create streams, the different intermediate and terminal stream operations, and collectors.  

The first demo will show you the different ways that you can create a Stream.

----

## Demo - Different Ways to Create Streams (10 min)

In our lessons thus far, we've only seen how to create a stream from a collection.  i.e.

    List<String> stringList = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
    Stream stringStream = stringList.stream();
    stringStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

But you don't need to start with a collection to create a stream. 

You can create a stream from an array:

    Integer[] intArray = new Integer[]{1,2,3,4};
    Stream intArrayStream = Stream.of(intArray);
    intArrayStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

Stream.of is a quick way to create a stream from your custom objects:

    Stream objectStream = Stream.of(100,200,300);
    objectStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

You can create streams by leveraging the Stream Builder, which is usually more efficient than the previous 2 examples because it doesn't need to use an array/ArrayList as a buffer when adding elements to the stream:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> stringStreamBuilder = Stream.builder();

stringStreamBuilder.accept("I really love ");
stringStreamBuilder.accept("streams and ");
stringStreamBuilder.accept("lambda expressions!!! ");

Stream<String> stringBuilderStream = stringStreamBuilder.build();
stringBuilderStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));
```

Output:

```text
I really love 
streams and 
lambda expressions!!! 
```

In the previous lesson we learned that stream operations are used to modify streams to produce a result. In the following sections, we are going to discuss several types of stream operations: intermediate, terminal, and comparison. 

- Intermediate operations are used for filtering, manipulating, and aggregating stream data. 
- Terminal operations are used to derive a result from a stream. 
- Comparison operations are a type of intermediate or terminal operation that compares items in a stream. 

In the following sections and demos, we will see why and when you'd use each type.

-----

## Demo - Intermediate Stream Operations (15 min)

We've learned previously that intermediate stream operations take a stream as input, modify the stream, and output a result stream. In this section, we will discuss some of the commonly used intermediate stream operations.  

The key takeaways about intermediate stream operations from this section should be:  
- **Intermediate stream operations quite surprisingly do not produce an end result! They use lazy evaluation, which means that stream processing does not activate until a _terminal stream operation_ is encountered.**
- **The order of your stream operations matter.  Ordering them incorrectly could have a negative performance impact.**

In this demo we'll first look at some of the commonly used intermediate stream operations.  After that we will see that no processing happens until a terminal operation occurs. And finally, we will look at what happens when you don't order your intermediate operations correctly.

### Commonly Used Intermediate Stream Operations

**Filter: selects elements based on a condition you provide**  
    
    //Filter - Get numbers greater than 50
    List<Integer> numberList = Arrays.asList(1,2,50,100);
    List<Integer> filteredNumberList =
            numberList.stream()
            .filter(number -> number > 50)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    filteredNumberList.forEach(number -> System.out.println(number));
    
Outputs:  

100

For the next demo examples, assume we have the following Person class:

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }


**map: is used to replace each incoming object from the source stream with a different object in the output stream, where the new object is formed by applying a lambda expression to the incoming object.**  

    //Map - Given the Person list, create a new list of their ages.
    List<Person> personList =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Tom", 30),
                    new Person("Jane", 45),
                    new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Integer> ageList =
            personList.stream()
            .map(person -> person.getAge())
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    ageList.forEach(age -> System.out.println(age));


Output is: 

30  
45  
70  

**flatmap: is used to combine (or "flatten") multiple incoming streams into a single stream**  

The following example will flatten a _list_ of person _lists_, List<List&lt;Person>>, into just a list of Persons, List&lt;Person>.  

    //FlatMap - flatten the list of person lists
    List<Person> personList1 =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Tom", 30),
                    new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Person> personList2 =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Jane", 45),
                    new Person("Alice", 38));
    // Create a List of Lists, containing both of our Person lists above
    List<List<Person>> listOfPersonLists = Arrays.asList(personList1, personList2);

    List<Person> flatPersonList =
            listOfPersonLists.stream()
                .flatMap(Collection::stream) // convert each list into a stream, then flatten them all into a single stream
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    flatPersonList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  

Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Alice', age=38}  

> The Collection:stream line basically says take the list streams from both lists and merge them.  

**sorted: is used to sort elements in a stream based on a given comparator**  

The following example will sort the list of Persons by name. 

    //Sorted - Sort the person list by name alphabetically
    List<Person> sortedList =
            personList.stream()
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    sortedList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  

### Stream Processing Doesn't Start Until We Have A Terminal Stream Operation  

We mentioned earlier that stream processing doesn't begin until a terminal stream operation is encountered, thanks to lazy evaluation.  See the example below:

    personList.stream()
        .filter(person -> {
            System.out.println("Person is: " + person);
            return person.getAge() > 30;
        });

If we tried to run the code above, there would be no output to the console. Now let's add a terminal operation and see what happens:

    personList.stream()
        .filter(person -> {
            System.out.println("Person is: " + person);
            return person.getAge() > 30;
        })
        .collect(Collectors.toList());


The output is:  

Person is: Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person is: Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person is: Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

### How Ordering is Important With Intermediate Operations   

The last example for this demo will show you how improperly ordering your intermediate operations can cause unnecessary processing.  Take a look at the following example:

    List<Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new Person("Tom", 30),
                new Person("John", 29),
                new Person("Jenny", 20),
                new Person("Mark", 35),
                new Person("Chris", 37),
                new Person("Paige", 31),
                new Person("Helen", 60),
                new Person("Erin", 50),
                new Person("Zach", 10),
                new Person("Jane", 45),
                new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Person> sortedAndFilteredList =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 31)
            .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    sortedAndFilteredList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  

Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

If you notice, we did the sort first, followed by the filtering.  The sort has to look through all 11 Person objects.  Then the filter by age has to again look through all 11 Person objects.  The last filter by _names that start with "J"_ has to look through 6 Person objects due to the previous age filter.  That's 28 total iterations, including a relatively large sort, of 11 items.  

What if we reordered the intermediate stream operations in the pipeline by putting the filters before the sort.  Which filter should be first?  I would say to pick the filter that produces the least results.  Which filter would that be? The age filter returns 6 results whereas the name filter returns 4.  Let's redo the example and see how many total iterations it will be after reordering.

    List<Person> filteredAndSortedList =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 31)
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    filteredAndSortedList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));


Output is:  

Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

The first name filter takes 11 iterations to filter the stream down to 4.  The age filter takes 4 iterations to filter the stream down to 2 Person objects.  Lastly, you have the sort of those 2 Person objects in the stream.  That's a total of 17 iterations, including a very small sort of just two items.  We've cut out 11 unnecessary iterations, and changed a long sort into a short one, just by reordering the pipeline! Moral of the story - do filtering first!

-----

## Terminal Stream Operations (15 min)

In the last section we learned about intermediate stream operations and how they can be used to manipulate streams. We also learned that stream processing doesn't start until there is a terminal stream operation. We will use this section to discuss terminal stream operations. As mentioned in the last functional programming module, terminal operations, such as forEach(), mark the stream as consumed, after which it can no longer be used.  

Some of the commonly used terminal stream operations are:  
- findFirst - returns the first entry in a stream
- collect - repackages the elements from the stream into another data structure such as a List or Map.
- toArray - converts the stream to an array

We will discuss several other useful terminal operations in the "Comparison Based Stream Operations" section below.

### Demo - Terminal Stream Operations  

For this short demo, we are going to show examples of using forEach, findFirst, collect, and toArray.  We will also leverage the same Person class that was used in the previous demo.

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }

### findFirst

Find the first person over the age of 35.

    Person personOverThirtyFive =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 35)
            .findFirst()
            .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(personOverThirtyFive);

Output:  

Person{name='Chris', age=37}

**Note:** Some stream operations, such as min, max, findFirst, return an instance of the _Optional_ class. This will be covered in detail in another module, but for now an Optional is a data structure that must contain exactly zero or one value. If zero, the Optional.orElse method returns the supplied value, in this case null. If one, orElse returns that value.

This is where the "orElse" clause comes in the previous example.  If no, result is found, it will return null.  However, we did find a result in our example.

### collect

Find persons whose name starts with the letter "J". Notice that since _collect(Collectors.toList())_ is a terminal operation that produces a List, we can immediately call another terminal operation "forEach" on that list, to print the elements of the resulting list.

    largePersonList.stream()
        .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
        .collect(Collectors.toList())
    .forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  

Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}

### toArray

Create an array from the largePersonList.

    Person[] personArray =
        personList.toArray(new Person[personList.size()]);

    System.out.println(personArray[0]);
    System.out.println(personArray[1]);
    System.out.println(personArray[2]);
    System.out.println(personArray[3]);
    System.out.println(personArray[4]);
    System.out.println(personArray[5]);
    System.out.println(personArray[6]);
    System.out.println(personArray[7]);
    System.out.println(personArray[8]);
    System.out.println(personArray[9]);
    System.out.println(personArray[10]);

Output:  

Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='Mark', age=35}  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}  
Person{name='Paige', age=31}  
Person{name='Helen', age=60}  
Person{name='Erin', age=50}  
Person{name='Zach', age=10}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}

> toArray is a convenient method on every collection, that returns the elements of the collection as an array.

## Comparison Based Stream Operations (15 min)

In the previous sections we discussed commonly used intermediate and terminal operations.  In this section, we will discuss useful stream operations that can be used for comparing items in a stream.  They are:

- sorted - intermediate operation that sorta a stream
- min - terminal operation that returns the minimum element based on a comparator
- max - terminal operation that returns the maximum element based on a comparator
- distinct - intermediate operation that eliminates duplicates in a stream, based on the equals() method of the stream elements

The following demo gives a little more detail of each one.

### Demo - Comparison Based Stream Operations

In this demo, we will take a look at each of the comparison based stream operations mentioned in the introduction. We will also be using the same Person class from the previous demos.

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }

### sorted 

We saw an example of this in the intermediate stream operation section.  The following example sorts the list of persons by name.

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> largePersonList =
            Arrays.asList(
                    Person("Tom", 30),
                    Person("John", 29),
                    Person("Jenny", 20),
                    Person("Mark", 35),
                    Person("Chris", 37),
                    Person("Paige", 31),
                    Person("Helen", 60),
                    Person("Erin", 50),
                    Person("Zach", 10),
                    Person("Jane", 45),
                    Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> sortedList =
            largePersonList.stream()
                    .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

    sortedList.forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  

Person{name='Chris', age=37}  
Person{name='Erin', age=50}  
Person{name='Helen', age=60}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Mark', age=35}  
Person{name='Paige', age=31}  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='Zach', age=10}  

### min

This example will return the youngest person. We can use Comparator.comparing for the lambda expression below to specify which class property to use.

    Person youngestPerson =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .min(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge))
            .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(youngestPerson);

Output:   

Person{name='Zach', age=10}  

### max

This example will return the oldest person. We can use 

    Person oldestPerson =
            largePersonList.stream()
                    .max(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge))
                    .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(oldestPerson);

Output:  

Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

### distinct

The following example will take a stream of integers that contains duplicates, and return a clone of that stream with duplicates removed.

    Stream<Integer> integerStream = Stream.of(1,1,2,2,3,4,5);

    integerStream
        .distinct()
        .forEach(integer -> System.out.println(integer));

Output:  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  

-----

## More Collectors

In the previous module, we talked briefly about collectors.  Again, collectors are used to collect data out of a stream and put it into a data structure. In this section, we will look at other data structures that we can collect to. They are:  

- toSet - similar to toList but returns a Set, (which is an unordered collection of unique elements.)
- toMap - creates a Map of key value pairs.
- groupingBy - allows you to partition a stream into groups.  Each key can have **one or more** values (Collection)

### Demo - More Collectors

For this demo, we will take a look at an example of each of the collector types mentioned in the introduction.  We will use the following class in some of the examples.

    public static class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            if (this == o) return true;
            if (!(o instanceof Person)) return false;
            Person person = (Person) o;
            return age == person.age &&
                    Objects.equals(name, person.name);
        }

        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return Objects.hash(name, age);
        }
    }

### toSet

This example will take a list that contains one duplicate and create a Set, (which discards the duplicates.) As usual, duplicates are defined as values that return true when compared using the .equals() method.

    Set<Person> personSet =
        duplicatePersonList.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());

    personSet.stream().forEach(person  -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  

Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  

### toMap

This example will create a map where the key is the person's name and the value is the age.  Notice that each entry in the map contains **one** String key and  **one** Integer value. Two Lambdas are used, one to define the key and the second to define the value, for each element.
    
    Map<String, Integer> nameToAgeMap =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(person -> person.getName(), person -> person.getAge()));

    nameToAgeMap.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println("Name is " + key + " and age is " + value));

Output: 

Name is Erin and age is 50  
Name is Paige and age is 31  
Name is Tom and age is 30  
Name is Zach and age is 10  
Name is Chris and age is 37  
Name is Jeff and age is 70  
Name is John and age is 29  
Name is Mark and age is 35  
Name is Jenny and age is 20  
Name is Jane and age is 45  
Name is Helen and age is 60  
Name is Tom and age is 30  
Name is Jenny and age is 20  

### Special Note about toMap and duplicate keys

If toMap encounters a duplicate key, then an exception will be thrown. ie.  

    List<CollectorsDemo.Person> duplicatePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new CollectorsDemo.Person("Tom", 30),
                new CollectorsDemo.Person("Tom", 30),
                new CollectorsDemo.Person("Jenny", 20));

    Map<String, Integer> nameToAgeDuplicateMap =
        duplicatePersonList.stream()
                .collect(Collectors
                        .toMap(person -> person.getName(),
                                person -> person.getAge()));

Output:  

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Duplicate key 30  

You can avoid this by passing a lambda expression as the 3rd argument to toMap, which will defines the value to use when a duplicate is encountered. ie.

    Map<String, Integer> nameToAgeDuplicateMap =
            duplicatePersonList.stream()
                    .collect(Collectors
                            .toMap(person -> person.getName(),
                                    person -> person.getAge(),
                                    (first, second) -> second));

    nameToAgeDuplicateMap.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println("Name is " + key + " and age is " + value));

Output:  

Name is Tom and age is 30  
Name is Jenny and age is 20  

If you look at the lambda expression that's provided to toMap:

    (first, second) -> second

This is essentially saying to take the last duplicate encountered.  If we specified "first", then it would take the first value and ignore all duplicates from that point on. 

### groupingBy

GroupingBy is an advanced partitioning that allows you to create custom groupings.  The following example will group all the persons based on the first letter of their name. The lambda expression passed to the groupingBy method tells the collector what to use for the map key. Notice that the value of the map is a List of **one or more Person instances**

    Map<Character, List<Person>> firstInitialMap =
            largePersonList.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(person -> person.getName().charAt(0)));


    //Check the number of elements in the map. It should be 8.
    System.out.println("Number of distinct first initials in the map is " + firstInitialMap.size());

    System.out.println("Persons with initial T");
    firstInitialMap.get('T').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial J");
    firstInitialMap.get('J').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial M");
    firstInitialMap.get('M').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial C");
    firstInitialMap.get('C').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial P");
    firstInitialMap.get('P').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial H");
    firstInitialMap.get('H').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial E");
    firstInitialMap.get('E').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

    System.out.println("Persons with initial C");
    firstInitialMap.get('C').forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  

Number of distinct first initials in the map is 8  
Persons with initial T  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Persons with initial J  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Persons with initial M  
Person{name='Mark', age=35}  
Persons with initial C  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}  
Persons with initial P  
Person{name='Paige', age=31}  
Persons with initial H  
Person{name='Helen', age=60}  
Persons with initial E  
Person{name='Erin', age=50}  
Persons with initial C  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}

## Independent Practice (15 min)

For the independent practice, we will take what we have learned in this module and put them to use. 

**Hint:**
You will need to use:
- filters
- min 
- max 
- toMap 
- groupingBy

## Conclusion

To recap, we have learned a great deal about streams and how to manipulate them using pipelines of intermediate and terminal operations. After going through this module, you can see how powerful streams and pipelines are.  They make the code more readable. The biggest benefit is that it saves you from having to write a lot of boiler plate code to convert data structures, making your code much more readable and maintainable. The syntax can get tricky at times, the best thing is to go slowly, try things out, let the IDE recommend changes, and work through examples. With that said, here are a few review questions:

 - Let's say that you only wanted your stream to contain objects of a certain criteria, what stream operation might you use?
 - If you have a scenario where you have to both sort and filter your stream, how would you order the pipeline to ensure that you don't do more processing than what's needed?
 - If you wanted to partition stream data into a Map, where the value of the map was a list, would you use a Collectors.toMap or Collectors.groupingBy?
