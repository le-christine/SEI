# Amex Capstone Project 

##  Implement React and Microservices

### Student Goal 

In pairs, design and develop a full-stack application implementing your idea, using React for the front-end and microservices for the back-end. Deploy your app on AWS.

### Summary

Through this project, students will demonstrate their ability to implement React and microservices, work with an SQL database, configure the build, and deploy their apps on AWS. As with other projects in the course, this will require proficiency in pair programming.

### Technical Requirements

Students' apps must:

- Separate front-end and back-end.
- Use the SQL database we covered in class (PostgreSQL).
- Have user services.
- Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for all of the models.
- Be bootstrapped with Spring Boot.
- Be deployed on AWS so it's publicly accessible.
- Stick with the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle.

### Necessary Deliverables

- User stories to show the work breakdown and project deliverables.
- A Git repository hosted on GitHub with a link to your hosted app.
- Around 50 (or more) commits on GitHub, dating back to the beginning of the project. (Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea of what you changed.)
- A `README.md` file with:
  - Explanations of the technologies used.
  - A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
  - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
  - A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies.
  - A link to your user stories — who your users are, what they want, and why.
  - A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.

### Assessment

The capstone project will be assessed in line with the [standard project guidelines](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/s2-projects/blob/master/project-assessment.md).
