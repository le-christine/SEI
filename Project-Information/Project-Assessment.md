## Project Assessment

The goal of project rubrics is to provide a consistent measure of student performance on projects throughout the course, as well as serve as a point of discussion and feedback during the student-instructor code review following each project. The scores that students receive on their projects — as measured by the project rubrics — are tied to graduation requirements for the course.

Project rubrics — including the rubric for the final capstone project — follow a consistent structure throughout the course. For each project, students are evaluated against the following criteria:

- Planning and project execution.
- Technical requirements.
- Code quality.
- Pair programming and working with other students' code.
- Problem-solving and perseverance.

### Passing a Project

Students will receive a score of 0–3 on each competency. Their final score will be the sum of their scores for each competency.

There are 15 points available in total. Students must receive a score of **10 or more** to pass the project.

For paired projects, each student will receive an individual score based on their own level of effort. (This means one student in a pair may pass a project while another may fail, depending on their respective levels of effort.)

---

### Failing a Project

If a student scores **below 10 points** on a project, or **if they receive a score of zero for the Technical Requirements competency**, they will fail the project.

> If a student scores a one in the Technical Requirements competency, the instructor should reconsider their overall score to see if the student should indeed pass the project (even if they score above 10 points).

After failing, students are allowed to resubmit their project on their own to receive a passing grade. Students may do this **once during the course**.

### Rubric

Below is the rubric that will be provided to students for each project. Students will receive this rubric prior to the start of their project so they're clear on expectations. The project workflow and technical requirements will vary by project and be provided to students in the project prompt (the detailed project description). 

| Competency | 0: Incomplete | 1: Does Not Meet Expectations | 2: Meets Expectations | 3: Exceeds Expectations |
| --- | -- | -- | --------- | -- |
| **Planning and Project Execution** | | | You planned your project before starting, mapping out key steps along with a timeline. You completed all deliverables required in the project prompt. | |
| **Technical Requirements** | | | You delivered a project that met all of the technical requirements in the project prompt. Given what the class has covered so far, you built something reasonably complex.| |
| **Code Quality** | | | You followed code style guidance and best practices. You added comments to your code. | |
| **Pair Programming and Working With Other Students' Code** | | | You verbally detailed your ideas and processes to your partner. You listened to your partner’s perspective and balanced being both the driver and observer. You and your partner submitted a project that displays a consistency of code style. You're able to work with previously created code. | |
| **Problem-Solving and Perseverance** | | | You're able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way and show that you thought through alternative implementations. You demonstrate grit and pursue your work with a need to finish despite setbacks and challenges. | |

### Providing Feedback

Student pair or instructor code reviews are a critical opportunity for feedback and learning. It’s a time when students can receive personalized guidance from an expert to improve their skills. 

Provide verbal or written feedback using this framework:

- **Score**: What was the student's score for each competency area? What was their total score?
- **Glows**: Share highlights and positive areas where the students went above and beyond the requirements. What about the app was exciting or intriguing for you as a user?
- **Grows**: Share growth areas around time management, workflow, and project approach. Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate difficulties the students encountered.
- **Next steps**: Help students prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. Set one or two specific goals for the next project. If you’re reviewing the second or third project with the student, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously.

Scores and feedback should be provided to students at the end of each project. Feedback should be provided during an in-person meeting (i.e., not via email or Slack).

### Notes

- It's important to remind students that getting a two on a certain competency is a **good thing**. They should aim for that score — there's nothing wrong with a two, and this means they're in good shape and doing everything well.
- After a project, instructors **are not required** to provide information on specific features or functionalities that students could incorporate to get a higher score. What constitutes a score is at the discretion of the instructors.
