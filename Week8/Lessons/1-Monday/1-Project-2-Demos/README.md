Demos are an Agile ceremony that are all about showing off work and accomplishments. 

They're important for several reasons:
- Give instructors insight into the work students are doing
- Give students practice presenting applications and code and talking through their design decisions
- Celebrate everyone's wins and progress!

Demos are a **must** at the end of a project week. They're optional (depending on time limits) but encouraged at the end of labs. The more practice students get defending their code, the better.

## Running a Demo

Students will have 3-5 minutes to present their work. If it's a pair project, both students should present.

The demo should include the following:  
- Show the app's functionality.
- Identify the aspect of the app they're most proud of.
- Identify the functionality of the app that was most challenging to build.
- Explain any important decisions that were made for the design and structure of the app.
