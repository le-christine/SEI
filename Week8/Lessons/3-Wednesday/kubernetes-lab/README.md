## Introduction

In this lab, we'll walk through Google's own tutorial on how to get up and running with Kubernetes on Google Cloud.

In our last lesson, we used Minikube to quickly spin up a simple Kubernetes cluster. However, Minikube isn't appropriate for production-level environments. 

For a production-grade Kubernetes cluster, there are several options. Google Cloud as [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) and [Amazon Web Services with Kops](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/kubernetes-clusters-aws-kops/) are the most popular ones and have extensive documentation.

If you were to choose between the two, it would ultimately come down to your familiarity and experience with these platforms. However, because Kubernetes came out of Google, the integration is seamless and you effectively get packaged Kubernetes. That's why we're using it today!
