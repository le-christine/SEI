## Introduction 

Let's get into another specialization in engineering, one that's pretty hot right now: **DevOps**. DevOps is a job title, a discipline, a philosophy, a way of life... it's a lot of things. Let's investigate.

## Dev + Ops = DevOps?

Well, the "Dev" stands for "development" and the "Ops" stands for "operations"... so it's development operations! OK, lesson over.

Obviously, it's not as simple as that. Let's watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg) to get a feel.

When we're done with the video, we'll discuss the following questions. Keep them in mind as you watch.

- What challenges does DevOps solve?
- What are the benefits of having a DevOps approach?
- What are some of the key principles of DevOps?
- What questions do you still have?

## DevOps Principles

DevOps isn't about building new applications or using cutting-edge technology. It's more about leveraging culture, collaboration, and process in order to get things done. Yes, that sounds like a bunch of corporate jargon, but it's the truth!

Here's one definition of DevOps:

> "DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably."

DevOps became a thing around 2008, when the tensions between development teams and operations teams (such as the ones we saw in the video) were coming to a head. For this reason, you'll often hear people talk about DevOps as a "transformation" or "transition," as it can be a fundamental shift in how legacy engineering organizations operate.

So, what does transformation actually mean in this context?

### Keep CALM(S) and DevOps

The core principles of DevOps can be summed up using the CALMS framework:

#### Culture

A lot of DevOps relies soft skills, or the culture and environment in which people work. Cross-functional collaboration is an important piece of DevOps culture, as is the Agile methodology.

> **Knowledge Check**: Can anyone recap some of the core principles of Agile?

#### Automation

The goal of DevOps is to build, test, and deploy production-ready code as quickly and easily as possible. Nothing makes that process go faster than automation. Continuous integration and delivery, or the practice of running any code change through a series of automated tests, is one step in the automation journey.

#### Lean

Being lean isn't just about being scrappy and fast. The Lean approach, championed by Toyota in the 1970s, also focuses heavily on continuous improvement (failing fast and learning from mistakes). This applies to improving *how* teams work together, as well as listening to customers and responding to their feedback.

#### Measurement

All of these DevOps ideas are nice, but without data, how do you know that they're improving how your team works? In DevOps, it's important to track internal metrics, such as time from development to deployment and how long it takes to recover from a system outage. It's also important to look at external metrics. For example, how many users did you gain or lose last week? How much time do people spend on your site?

#### Sharing

Development and operations teams were long at odds with each other: They had no common objectives, metrics, or processes to unite around. Sharing goals, successes, failures, and responsibility goes a long way toward bridging the divide between the two teams.

## A Day in the Life

So, what does this look like in practice? Let's find out!

With a partner, visit your favorite job search website (maybe Indeed, LinkedIn, or Glassdoor) and search for DevOps jobs. You might want to search for phrases like "DevOps engineer" or "DevOps architect."

Review the responsibilities and requirements in the job listings. Consider the following:

- What appears consistently? 
- What jumps out at you?
- What questions do you have?
