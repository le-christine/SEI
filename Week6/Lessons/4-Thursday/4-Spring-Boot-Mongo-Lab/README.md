## Opening

We're again going to create a [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) clone but this time we will do it using MongoDB as our database. This will be a very simple application built just for your practice. You will again work in pairs for this lab.

## Requirements

- You need to have at least two models `User` and `Song`.
- `User` object should have at least two fields `username` and `password`
- `Song` object should have at least two fields `title` and `length`
- You should create APIs to do CRUD on both `User` and `Song` collections
- `Song` should either be referenced or embedded into `User`

We will leave this on you to decide whether to embed or reference `Song` in a `User`. You should be able to defend the choice you make. There are no right or wrong answers here. Keep it mind though that you are working with a NoSQL database, try to use that to your advantage. It is very natural to confuse NoSQL with SQL database.

## Deliverables

Collaborate and push your changes to a GitHub repo.

You will maintain a README which will have the following,

- Link to GitHub repo
- All your design decisions 
- Reasons behind each decision
- Which DB do you prefer, SQL or NoSQL?
- What went right?
- Challenges you faced
- Which part you enjoyed working on the most?
