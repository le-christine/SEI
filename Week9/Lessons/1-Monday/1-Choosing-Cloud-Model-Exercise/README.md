## Introduction

We learned a bit about the three most common cloud computing models and spent some time exploring PaaS (as we'll be using that technology in the course).

However, we don't want to forget about the other two models! As a developer, it's important to understand the range of options available to you and choose the option that best solves your needs.

## Cloud Shakedown: Debate and Defend

> **Knowledge Check**: Based on what we've already learned, can someone define IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

We can think of the three models in terms of everyone's favorite food:

Or, in more technical terms, we can compare what each model provides:

But still: What makes each model great? Why would you choose one over the other? Let's debate and defend!

I'll divide the class into three groups and assign each group a model. Your task is to take 15 minutes to research and answer these questions:

- What makes your model unique?
- What are the benefits of your model?
- What types of businesses are best suited for your model?
- Who are some of the top providers?
- What are some of the drawbacks or challenges of your model?

Each group will present its findings back to the class in five minutes or less.

After that, we'll debate and defend which model should be used in each of these scenarios:

1. A small startup that provides personalized travel itineraries via a mobile app.
1. A large media company that is starting to expand internationally.
1. A private bank that operates in 15 countries.
1. A university that needs to maintain its website and blog.
