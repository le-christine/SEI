Retros allow students to reflect on the "how" behind the work they've accomplished, not just the "what".

Retros should happen at the end of a project week and focus on the work students accomplished related to their project.

## Running a Retro

Retros should involve the entire class. Each student (and instructors!) will have a chance to answer the following questions:
- What did you accomplish that you're proud of?
- What could have been done better or differently?
- What did you enjoy working on? What did you learn?

Students should spend 2-3 minutes answering the questions and get as specific as possible. It's okay if answers are focused specifically on *their* work (not on how the course is going overall, or how the class is working together) - this is a time to reflect on what's happening and what could be improved.
