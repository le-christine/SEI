A "stand up" is a meeting that typically lasts between 5-15 minutes where attendees stand to keep the meeting "short and sweet".

From Wikipedia: *"Some software development methodologies envision [stand] to make commitments to team members. The daily commitments allows participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues."*

During the course, we do a stand up as a class every day during project weeks. Since those days are very unstructured, daily stand ups ensure that students arrive on time and kick off the day. It's also a chance to get insight into how students are progressing on their projects and what blockers may be in their way.

## How Stand Ups Work

A stand up involves each member of the team answering these three questions:

- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- What are my blockers (obstacles are impeding my progress)?

Each person should spend no more than 90 seconds answering the questions.

The first two questions help with accountability and as a way to reflect. The final question can be addressed using help from other members of the team or a manager.

The final question will be important in identifying what is holding students back from making progress on particular features and how group members or the instructional team might help.

## Running a Stand Up

Divide the class into groups of 5-10 people. (Running a stand up as a class of 20 people would get pretty tedious.) Try to switch up the groups of students each time.

In small groups, students should take turns answering the three questions (while standing!).

When each group is done, ask students if they want to share any of their blockers with the instructors or with the larger class. Encourage them to do this! This might help them get to solutions more quickly by crowd-sourcing ideas and resources, or uncover themes that many students are blocked by.
