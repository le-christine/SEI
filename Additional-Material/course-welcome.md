Your day 1 presentation! Use this material to welcome and onboard students into their GA experience.

Day 1 should also include Installfest, which is here.

## Welcome!

Welcome to your first day of your General Assembly course! We'll start off by having your instructors introduce themselves. Each instructor will tell you:

- Name
- Preferred Pronoun
- What they were doing before joining GA

After that, we'll give you an overview of the schedule for the first day.

----

## Icebreaker

First, let's do some introductions!

For the icebreaker, you'll pair up with the person sitting next to you. Get a white board marker from one of the instructors and find some space on the whiteboard walls.

Start by introducing yourself: what is your name? What brought you to GA? Diversity and inclusion are really important to us here at General Assembly. So when you introduce yourself, you should feel free to provide your preferred pronouns if you would like to.

Once you've finished your introductions, create a mind map of your partner! Your mind map should have your partner's name in the center, drawings of the things they like on the left side, and drawings of the things they dislike on the right side.

You'll have a few minutes to complete your mindmaps. Afterwards, you'll introduce your partner! Be sure to include their name, their likes and dislikes, and their preferred gender pronouns (if they gave them).

### Project Weeks

Weeks 3, 8, and 12 will be time for you to work on your project. There will be no scheduled lessons but you are expected to come to campus each day to work on your projects. Outcomes will meet as usual.

-----

## Important Things to Know

### Outcomes

You will meet with your outcomes coach every week for 1.5 hours, including during project weeks. Each week, you will work towards making yourself job-search-ready through a series of planned lessons and activities.

Some students in the past have put-off their outcomes homework. **This is a terrible idea.** The purpose of this course is to train you to get a job as a junior developer. Before you can even apply for a job you'll need a resume, you'll need to learn how to write cover letters for technical roles, you'll need to learn how technical interviews work. Each of those are homework assignments or exercises you'll do with outcomes.

Please don't put off your outcomes work. Regardless of what else is going on in the course, please make time and space to dedicate towards your outcomes work. It's really important!

### Instructor Communication

The instructors are here for you and to help you succeed, but we can't be available to you you 24/7. There will be dedicated time for instructors to provide students with in-person support outside of lessons. 

These are times when instructors are available to help you with bugs, answer questions or provide advice. The goal of this program is to turn you in to a self-sufficient software engineer, so our expectation is that you try to resolve issues on your own as much as possible. We use the remaining time to prepare lessons, grade projects, etc.

However, if you have any questions concerning the course, your progress, challenges you are facing, or any other non-technical concerns that you would like to discuss, you are welcome to Slack instructors to set up one-on-one meetings. If you reach out via Slack in the evening, the instructor will probably respond by the next day.

### Asking for Help

Asking for help is what students find hardest in courses like this. It is also what ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.

- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
- Knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers are two of the biggest skills you can gain from this class and will be incredibly valuable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

How can we ask for help efficiently?

- Ask a question about a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear question or a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
- Your instructors and peers won't be able to help you if:
  - The question you're asking isn't constructive
  - It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer. This means taking the following steps:
    - First, try it yourself
    - Then, Google it
    - Then, ask your neighbor
    - Finally, ask an instructor

### Gradual Release of Resposibility

Being able to ask for help effectively will become increasingly crucial as the course progresses. During the first project, for example, we will be holding office hours throughout the dedicated project days. By the fourth project, however, all support will be conducted using Github issues. Between those two projects, instructors will be placing an increasing onus on the students to solve problems on their own with increasingly limited instructor support -- what we call a "gradual release of responsibility."

While instructors love helping out, we've found that students become stronger developers by learning to solve their own problems. Your instructors won't be following you to your jobs so it's important to develop a sense of self-sufficiency while you're here.

## Policies and Requirements

### Homework

In order to pass the course, you must submit 80% of the homework assignments. Homework is assessed on a pass / fail basis. Plagiarized homework will not be accepted.

Here are the instructions for submitting homework assignments.

### Attendance

Attendance is taken every morning at 9:00am.

In order to pass the course, you cannot be absent more than 3 days during the course. You cannot be tardy more than 9 days during the course. 3 tardy arrivals = 1 absence.

### Plagiarism

General Assembly is not a traditional educational institution, but we share some things in common. We have a plagiarism policy in place to create a healthy classroom culture where students prioritize their learning above all other goals for the duration of the cohort. We create a space where it is 'safe to fail' since 'failure' is such an integral part of the learning process.

- You can't ask external people to do your work
- You must understand your submissions -- if you can't explain them then the assumption is that you plagiarized
- If you collaborate, you have to indicate that you did in a comment on the submission
- You have to comment where you have used the solution branch (if one exists) or if you have used an external resource such as a tutorial

## What is an "Immersive" Course?

Spend two minutes discussing some answers to the following question: What does it mean to be in an "immersive" environment?

### There's no winning or losing

- This is a non-competitive environment.
- You get out what you put in.
- Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you only.
- Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

### Cooperation

- You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding together for the next 12 weeks.

### Re-learning how to learn
- The most significant skill you will gain from this course is not proficiency in a particular web framework or programming language, but rather learning how to teach yourself
- You will learn this in an environment that is specifically tailored to this goal, where there is heavy support, instruction designed to structure your self-learning process, and safety to 'fail'.
- We will progressively "back off" over the course of the cohort, encouraging the development of your autonomy as a developer, allowing you to stand strong on your own.

### You will be uncomfortable - regularly

- Don't be too hard on yourself.
- You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.

### Productive struggle

- The pace of this course is designed to push you past your limits.
- The brain is like a muscle; sometimes it gets sore.
- Struggling with the material doesn't mean you aren't learning; on the contrary, it reflects sustained and meaningful engagement with the material.

### Embrace failure

- Here we learn by doing, and things don't always (and usually won't) go right the first time.
- This is normal. Expect it.
- Fail often and learn from it.

### Nothing is magic

*"Magic is indistinguishable from any sufficiently advanced technology" -Arthur C Clarke*

- Humans have reached a considerable degree of technological sophistication, there are so many places where we can begin to discover how a technology works, how the technology developed, how the technology is put together, what problem does the technology solve (or what does it make it easier to do?) etc.
- 'The Programmer's Mindset' will come with time, but it begins with the question, "How is this working?"

### Balance

- This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
- Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

### We will not give up on you

-  Even when you might have given up on yourself!
- None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're passionate about web development, education, your interests, and your professional and personal growth.

### Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience

- We have a large body of knowledge, experience, and expertise to draw on from the iterative nature of GA's immersive coding courses.
- Each iteration of our courses has been driven in part by student feedback, and for that reason, we rely on your feedback. Please don't hesitate to provide us with feedback!

### We are here to navigate, you are here to drive

- We will teach every lesson as best we can, but if you don't pay attention then there's no point.
- Past students have said, "this program works if you do" and that is 100% true.
- We will navigate you through the process of becoming a junior web developer but you have to do the pedaling.

### Embrace growth mindset

[Let's watch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY)

This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done - the first time you've been bad at something in a long time. You will fail and struggle at times, but that's important. We don't succeed despite challenges - we succeed because of challenges.

- Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
- We anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, that's when it is time to really challenge yourself and buckle down. Don't quit! Embrace the fact that the challenge will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.

Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

The growth mindset here is understanding that even when something doesn't work, it will still make you a better coder! We want this to be challenging for you because...

- Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
- You can't BS your way through code.
- The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
- Google is your best friend

Throughout the course, many students will say something along the lines of "I don't know how to do that." Many of you certainly will. If you do, however, just add "...yet" to the end of that sentence.
