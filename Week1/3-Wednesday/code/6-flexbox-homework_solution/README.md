# Flexbox Homework

For this assignment, you'll create a National Park website using your newfound flexbox abilities! ðŸ’ª You've been given a half-empty `style.css` file with a bunch of blank declarations you'll have to fill in with the correct number of properties (for example, `display: flex` is one property).

You'll be working in `styles/style.css`. Good luck!

_Hint: Open up `index.html` in the browser and refresh it every time you make a change in the CSS._

### Here's Your Mockup:
