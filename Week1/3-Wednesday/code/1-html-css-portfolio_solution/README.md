# Hippie Portfolio

Your client, Spirit Dunkin, has hired you to build the website for her flower shop. She has provided a mockup in addition to all of the images she wants to include. Your job is to update the HTML and CSS in the starter code to match her design as closely as possible.

Two CSS helpers, `reset.css` and `normalize.css`, have been provided for your convenience. Feel free to use either, both, or neither. (You can read about each of them [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and [here](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)). There are also a few hints in the `style.css` file to help get you started.

Remember â€” small steps!
