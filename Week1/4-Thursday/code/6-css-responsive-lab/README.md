# Responsive Mockup Lab

## Exercise

You are being given a completed static website. However, it is not responsive! Your task is to take the site and make it responsive. Follow the directions at the bottom of `/css/main.css`.

## Mockups

Here's a full-size mockup of what the site looks like: [mockup](./responsive-spec.png).

Here's what the small or mobile version of the site should look like: [mockup](./responsive-spec-small-screen.png).

Good luck!
