*"'Dependency injection' is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept."*
([Source](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html))

**Dependency injection** (DI) and **inversion of control** (IoC) are two software design patterns that go hand in hand. They're also two fundamental principles of the Spring framework. 

Let's start exploring them! For this exercise, we'll get into groups of four people.

**Part 1**

Two people will research dependency injection and two people will research inversion of control.

Throughout the course of your research, answer the following questions:

- What is this pattern all about? (Bonus: What's a real-life analogy you can use to explain it?)
- What problems does it solve? What are the benefits?
- What are some drawbacks?
- How is it implemented in Spring?
- Identify 1â€“2 specific examples or scenarios in which this pattern is used. (Bonus points for showing the code, too!)

**Part 2**

When each pair is done researching its pattern, come back together as your foursome. Explain to the other pair what you learned about your pattern. 

Based on each pair's research, answer the following questions:

- How do DI and IoC work together?
- Review the scenarios you found. Are they different or similar? What role does each pattern play?
- How do both of the concepts show up in some of the Spring apps we've built so far?

Take about 40 minutes to complete Parts 1 and 2. After that, we'll reconvene as a class to discuss your findings.
