Welcome to Part 2 of your Spring design patterns research!

We're going to look at two **creational design patterns** used widely in Spring (and lots of other frameworks and languages): **singleton** and **factory**.

As you'll recall from our introduction to design patterns, creational design patterns are concerned with how we make objects and classes. The factory and singleton patterns are used to achieve very different goals but can come together in some interesting ways.

Once again, we'll break into four-person groups for this teach-back.

**Part 1**

Two people will research the factory pattern and two people will research the singleton pattern.

Throughout the course of your research, answer the following questions:

- What is this pattern all about? (Bonus: What's a real-life analogy you can use to explain it?)
- What problems does it solve? What are the benefits?
- What are some drawbacks?
- How is it implemented in Spring?
- Identify 1â€“2 specific examples or scenarios in which this pattern is used. (Bonus points for showing the code, too!)

**Part 2**

When each pair is done researching its pattern, come back together as your foursome. Explain to the other pair what you learned about your pattern.

Then, based on each pair's research, answer the following questions (you might need to do some additional research):

- What's the difference between the factory pattern and singleton pattern?
- When might they work together?
- Review the scenarios you found. Are they different or similar? What role does each pattern play?
- How do both of the concepts show up in some of the Spring apps we've built so far?

Take about 40 minutes to complete Parts 1 and 2. After that, we'll reconvene as a class to discuss your findings.
