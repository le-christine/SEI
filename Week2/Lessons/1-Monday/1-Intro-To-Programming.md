## What Is Programming?


**You do:**

Spend five minutes writing out your understanding of programming. What is it? What does it mean? Try not to look at the definition below.

---


```
Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next.
These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a webpage, or
a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described
as a mix between art and science; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.
```
  — [Karen McCandless](https://news.codecademy.com/what-is-computer-programming/)


There are a few parts to our answer:

1. Programming is a verb: We're doing something — namely, creating a program.
1. Programming is about interacting with computers. We're trying to get the computer to do something, after all.
1. Programming is about solving problems.
1. Programming is creative.

How do these points stack up against what was in your answer?

### Programming Languages

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of programming languages — some are general use and versatile, while others are extremely specialized. But what is a programming language? Why are there so many? If programming is solving problems with programs, then how does a programming language fit in?

Programming languages are how we communicate with computers. We can't just say, "Hey computer, multiply 5 times 9," but we can use a programming language to say `5 * 9`. Programming languages are how we express our solution to a problem to our computer and other developers. We call them **languages** because they are written, have grammar and syntax, and are used to express ourselves (just like English or any other spoken language).

Each programming language is different, but the principles of programming are shared across all languages.

## Thinking Like a Programmer

This exercise will get you primed to start thinking like a programmer. What does it mean to think like a programmer?

Well, being a programmer means taking complex problems, breaking them down into smaller parts, then writing code to solve each small part. Thinking like a programmer is that process: taking a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, then solving each part to assemble a final solution.

**You do:**

Read through [this article](https://zellwk.com/blog/think/) on thinking like a programmer. When you're done, turn to your neighbor and discuss the following:

* Why do we need to break a problem down into smaller problems?
* How do we take a problem and identify the smaller problems we need to solve?
* Once we've solved our smaller problems, are we finished? What might come next?
* What might a list of steps be for approaching a problem? (Hint: Write them down.)

## Programming Terminology and Why You Need to Learn It

Consider this medical analogy:
```
I’m going to use the electric shock that’s a form of medicine if you’re very ill,
but can make you sort of ill if you’re fine. Clear!
Oh, no! He was fine. Now he’s poorly from too much electric.
— That Mitchell and Webb Look
```
Doctors don't discuss diagnoses with each other in simple terms. Medical schools don’t teach in simple terms, either. Medicine is complicated, so they communicate with a complicated set of terminology. Everyone understands the term "broken leg," but that's too vague for a medical diagnosis. Using precise terminology like "transverse compound fracture of the tibia" allows medical staff and students to communicate accurately.

Programming is not as complex as the human body — but it's still complex. This complexity is why programming has so much terminology. There are lots of concepts, and all of those concepts have names. Just like in medicine, we use terminology to communicate accurately, because simple terms are often too vague.

I’d love to give you, "This man shares his three quick tips to understand programming." But there are no three tips that will fix this problem. You just have to invest time into learning the vocabulary.

## A List of Basic Programming Terms
Here are the definitions for some basic programming terms, along with usage examples. These terms are applicable to most programming languages. We don't have to go over the entire list of terms.

Look over the list and pick out the **top three** you're most confused about or want to explore further. When you have them, jot each one down on a separate Post-it note. Bring them to the front of the room, and we'll group them together to see which terms are most confusing to people. Then, we'll discuss what we don't know.


- **Algorithm**

    - (Noun) A step-by-step procedure to achieve a specific goal; can be implemented with code.
    - Example: I used the quicksort algorithm to sort the array alphabetically.

- **Argument**

    - (Noun) A value passed into a function when it's called. Arguments are said to be "passed" into a function, and functions are said to "take" arguments; also known as a "parameter."
    - Example: That function takes two arguments.

- **Array**

    - (Noun) A type of value containing a sequence of other values.
    - Example: I put all our names into an array of strings.

- **Assign**

    - (Verb) The act of putting a value into a variable.
    - Example: I assigned the number 22 to the `age` variable.

- **Brackets**

    - (Noun) Characters often used to surround text. The different types of brackets are:
      - Parentheses/parens/round brackets: `( )`
      - Curly brackets/braces: `{ }`
      - Angle brackets: `< >`
      - Square brackets: `[ ]`
    - The bracket at the beginning is called the "opening" or "left" bracket. The bracket at the end is called the "closing" or "right" bracket.
    - Example: Your code won't compile because you forgot a closing bracket.

- **Boolean**

    - (Noun) A binary variable having two possible values: `true` or `false`.
    - Example: Because the answer will always be yes or no, I can use a Boolean to represent it.

- **Bug**

    - (Noun) A mistake in a program.
    - Example: There must be a bug because the output is wrong.

- **Call**

    - (Verb) To run the code in a function; also referred to as "running," "executing," or "invoking" a function. For the noun, see "function call."
    - Example: I called the function and it returned 42.

- **Comment**

    - (Noun) Arbitrary text written around code, which is never run and generally ignored by the computer; used to leave notes and documentation for people who read the code later; also used to stop code from running (see "comment out").
    - Example: I wrote comments in my code so I could understand it later.

- **Comment out**

    - (Verb) To turn code into a comment so it won't run.
    - Example: I commented out this line of code, and it doesn’t crash anymore.

- **Crash**

    - (Verb) To cause a running program to stop due to an error.
    - Example: I tried to divide a number by zero, which crashed the program.

- **Data structure**

    - (Noun) A value containing other values.
    - Example: Arrays are one kind of data structure.

- **Debug**

    - (Verb) To investigate and fix bugs.
    - Example: I spent all day debugging a complicated error.

- **Declaration**

    - (Noun) Code that declares that something exists — usually a variable, function, or a class. A declaration might not fully define the thing it is declaring. For example, a constant may be declared to exist without actually defining its value. Not all programming languages allow for declarations.
    - Example: My code won't compile because I wrote a function declaration, but I forgot to write the actual function.

- **Execute**

    - (Verb) Synonym for run.
    - Example: I can't execute my program because it won't compile.

- **Float**

    - (Noun) A type of value representing numbers with fractional parts; short for "floating-point number."
    - Example: The value 3.14 is a float.

- **Function**

    - (Noun) A piece of code that doesn't run until it's called. Functions take zero or more arguments. When a function finishes running, it returns a value back to the code that called it.
    - Example: I wrote a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the average.

- **Function call**

    - (Noun) Code for calling a function. Function calls specify which function to call and include all of the arguments the function requires. The result of a function call is a return value. Not all functions have a return value.
    - Example: The function call `add(1, 2, 3)` returns the value `6`.

- **Implement**

    - (Verb) To write all of the code to complete something — usually a function or a class.
    - Example: I finished implementing those functions.

- **Integer**

    - (Noun) A type of value representing whole numbers. For fractional numbers, see "float."
    - Example: `42` is an integer value.

- **Invoke**

    - (Verb) Synonym for call.
    - Example: I invoked the function with the wrong arguments, and it crashed.

- **Iterate**

    - (Verb) Synonym for loop.
    - Example: I iterated over all of the values in the array.

- **Loop**

    - (Noun) A piece of code that runs itself repeatedly; commonly used to run a piece of code for every value in an array; also known as "iteration."
    - Example: I used a `for` loop to get the sum of all of the values in an array.
    - (Verb) To run repeatedly.
    - Example: The code loops until the user types in `quit`.

- **Method**

    - (Noun) A function attached to an object. Methods belong to — and are defined in — a class. Also known as a "member function."
    - Example: The `length` method returns the number of characters in a string object.

- **Nested**

    - (Adjective) Contained within something like itself (e.g., a nested array is an array inside another array).
    - Example: I used a nested loop to loop over a grid — the outer loop for the `x` coordinate, and the inner loop for the `y` coordinate.

- **Object**

    - (Noun) An unordered collection of related data in the form of key-value pairs.
    - Example: I make the enemy move by changing the `position` instance variable of the `Enemy` object.

- **Object-oriented**

    - (Adjective) Designed using objects.
    - Example: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language because all values are objects in Ruby.

- **Parameter**

    - (Noun) Synonym for argument.
    - Example: That function takes two parameters.

- **Program**

    - (Noun) A full piece of software that is ready to be run.
    - Example: I wrote a program that keeps track of my to-do list.

- **Return**

    - (Verb) To immediately stop a called function from running, possibly providing a return value. A function automatically returns once all of its code has been run. However, the code in the function definition can force the function to return at any point.
    - Example: If the array is empty, the function returns early without running the rest of its code.

- **Return value**

    - (Noun) The value that results from a completed function call.
    - Example: The return value of the `rand` function is a random float between `0.0` and `1.0`.

- **Run**

    - (Verb) To perform the instructions written in code or an executable file. Code is a set of instructions, and "running" code is when the computer actually performs those instructions. To run a function means to call that function (see "call").
    - Example: I wrote a new feature and ran the code to check that it works.

- **String**

    - (Noun) A type of value representing text. The word "string" derives from the phrase "string of characters." For example, the string "cat" is a string (aka, sequence) of the characters '`c'`, `'a'`, and `'t'`.
    - Example: I represented my name as a string in the code.

- **Syntax**

    - (Noun) The grammatical rules of a programming language. Every programming language has different syntax. Syntax determines whether code is written correctly or incorrectly and is enforced by the compiler or interpreter. Code will not compile or run unless the syntax is correct.
    - Example: I forgot to write the brackets, so I got a syntax error.

- **Value**

    - (Noun) A piece of data contained inside a variable. Every value has a type. Values represent information in a way that code can work on. Code can send and receive values over the internet, save values into files, convert values into different values, and more.
    - Example: My program asks a user for the year they were born then uses that value to calculate their age.

- **Variable**

    - (Noun) A named container for a single value. Variables are not values themselves — they're merely containers for values. Putting a value into a variable is referred to as assignment. Variables are named after the fact that their value can vary: A different value can be assigned to a variable at any time.
    - Example: I assigned the string value "Tom" to the `name` variable.
