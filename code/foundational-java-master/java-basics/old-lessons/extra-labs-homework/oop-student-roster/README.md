> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will be making an app that manages the student roster of a class. The app selects a random student to call on!

#### Requirements

- The Student Roster screen should have a list of student names

  - Note: it is suggested to pre-populate this list with a few students


- There should be a button that allows you to select a random student; when the button is clicked, a screen (either a dialog or an activity) should pop up, showing *at least* the random student's name

- You *must* define and use a Student class

**Bonus:**
- Add a button to add students to the list
- Ensure that your app does not call on the same person twice in a row!

#### Deliverable

A working app following the requirements above. Fork, clone, and push.
