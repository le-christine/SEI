## Exercise

In pairs, you are going to be writing a Java app that picks a random integer, and the user guesses whether the number is even or odd by typing in "even" or "odd". They get a point if they are correct. The user is asked to guess 5 times, and if they get at least 3 points, they get a message saying they won. If not, they get a message saying they lost.

#### Requirements

The entire logic for guessing and checking the user answer must be in a separate method that you call from your main method.

1. In groups of 4, write pseudocode on the whiteboards to complete this app
2. In groups of 2, write the Java code for the program

**Bonus:**

- Display the running total of the score
- Ask the user if they would like to start a new game when the current one is over

#### Deliverable

A java app that meets the above requirements.
